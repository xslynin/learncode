some critical dangrous in my code, 

when you succeed to apply the major number and minor
	now if your register of device fail but the number is still available
		but you just retur the error withour the handler for above situation
			just every goes damn

now think another situation

when you succeed to apply the major number and minor's,
the register of device surely done,
	everything goes well but, how about your fair operation in init function fail?
		like, the dynamic address map fail, 
			so you should do something for a fairly end!

when you go in the 1234, out for the 4321 plz

the nice handle is : goto  some fair funciton, like :

flag4:
	do something 

flag3:
	...

flag2:

flag1:
	...
	return -xxx
flag0:
	return 0


high number don't need to return, cause it should finish previous "end operation"
one level by one level

so called reflection
